<p>There is one injector per Angular application. Normally you don't
	need to interact with it directly. The injector is key to making
	dependency injection work in Angular. Module methods such as factory,
	service, directive, etc. register these items with the injector. When
	you inject something (e.g., a service into a controller), the injector
	will lookup and then instantiate the service (if it wasn't instantiated
	already -- if it was, it will return the already-instantiated object).

	If for some reason you really needed to dynamically inject a service
	into, say, a controller, see
	https://stackoverflow.com/a/14418384/215945 for an example of how to do
	that. See also https://stackoverflow.com/a/14743553/215945.</p>
